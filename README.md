About the Project:

The mission statement for AOE2 AutoCoach is as follows.

The goal is for AutoCoach is to catalogue as much as the Arabia meta decision-making process as possible in order to provide a free tool for players to use to inform their dynamic strategic knowledge of the game beyond mere build orders. 

Players who have learned build orders but face difficulties knowing the correct decisions to make in different scenarios are the intended audience for the tool. An estimate of the Elo range that the tool will benefit the most is 1300-1900.

The project will not diminish the need for high level players selling coaching services as they are able to offer customised and specific advice that the tool will not be able to replicate.

All contributions are voluntary and done purely through passion for AOE2 and as a result the finished product will never be monetised. Should the need to pay for server hosting arise, the funding will hopefully be donation based.
